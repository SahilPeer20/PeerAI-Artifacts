# Epic: Hybrid Development Mode (Dev Mode)

**Product:** Serverless

**Priority:** Medium

**Status:** Generated

## Description

**Why does this epic matter?**

Hybrid Development Mode ("serverless dev") is a game-changer for developer productivity. It allows for rapid iteration by routing live cloud events to local code, reducing deployment cycles from minutes to seconds. This addresses the #1 user friction point in serverless development: slow and cumbersome deployment for every code change. It also improves debugging and reduces cloud costs during development, increasing satisfaction and adoption.

**Connection to Initiative Goals**:
Accelerates development velocity and reduces idle costs, directly supporting the product vision.
