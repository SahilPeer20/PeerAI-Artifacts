# Epic: Infrastructure as Code (Serverless YAML Configuration)

**Product:** Serverless

**Priority:** Medium

**Status:** Generated

## Description

**Why does this epic matter?**

The Infrastructure as Code (IaC) epic establishes the backbone for all serverless deployments via a declarative YAML approach. This reduces cognitive overhead, accelerates onboarding, and enables application portability. It directly addresses developer pain points around infrastructure complexity, reduces configuration errors, and allows for rapid, repeatable deployments. By providing a single source of truth, it aligns infrastructure management with modern DevOps and GitOps best practices, driving down operational costs and increasing reliability.

**Connection to Initiative Goals**:
This epic is critical for fulfilling the vision of enabling developers to build serverless applications with minimal infrastructure knowledge and maximum development velocity.
