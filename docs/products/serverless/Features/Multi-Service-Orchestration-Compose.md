# Feature: Multi-Service Orchestration (Compose)

**Product:** Serverless

**Epic:** s: Serverless Framework v4

**Priority:** Medium

**Status:** Generated

## Description

**As a** DevOps engineer or architect  
**I want** to define and orchestrate the deployment of multiple serverless services with dependencies  
**So that** I can manage large, modular applications with reliable deploy order and shared resources

**Summary**:  
Multi-Service Orchestration enables users to define multiple services in a single `serverless-compose.yml` file, specify dependencies, and deploy them in parallel or sequence as needed. Outputs (such as resource ARNs) can be shared between services, and global commands can be run across all services in a project, streamlining operations for teams and complex applications.
