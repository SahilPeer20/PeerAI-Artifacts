## Description

**As a** Mission Planner  
**I want** a visual, drag-and-drop interface to build missions by selecting aircraft, pilots, routes, and objectives  
**So that** I can create complete mission plans quickly without navigating multiple systems or manual data entry

**Summary**: The Mission Builder Interface provides a centralized, visual workspace where mission planners can construct missions by dragging elements (aircraft, pilots, waypoints, objectives) onto a planning canvas. This feature integrates real-time aircraft availability, pilot scheduling, and mission templates to streamline the mission creation process from 2+ hours to under 30 minutes for standard missions.
